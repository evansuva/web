<p>For tenure-track professors at research-focused universities, teaching
is not considered an important part of your job.  So long as you don&rsquo;t
do so badly to engender a stream of complaints to your dean, being a
mediocre teacher is unlikely to harm your tenure case; even if you are a
spectaular teacher, it won&rsquo;t help make up for weaknesses in your
research record.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs1120-f11/all/2011/class-41-the-cake-of-computing"><img src="../images/cake-2.jpg" width="250" class="rightbar" alt="cake"></a></p>

<p>So, if the only thing that matters to you is getting tenure, you should
aim to teach at a level just above the &ldquo;threshold of embarrassment&rdquo;, and
<a href="/evans/paradise/research/">skip the rest of this section</a>.  Hopefully,
however, you came to a university because you want to teach, and will
find teaching to be the most rewarding, fulfilling, and impactful aspect
of your career.</p>

<p>If you aren&rsquo;t sure if you find teaching gratifying yet, its worth
putting in the energy to be an extraordinary teacher at least once to
discover if you do.  I&rsquo;ve seen too many new faculty start their
tenure-track positions overly stressed out about getting research
funding and being advised not to spend too much time teaching. This
inevitably leads to a bad first teaching experience, and the victims
concluding that they shouldn&rsquo;t care about teaching but instead should
treat it as a necessary burden of their faculty position.  If you find
you really don&rsquo;t enjoy teaching enough to want to do it well, you&rsquo;d be
much better off finding a position that does not expect you to teach.</p>

<h1 id="how-to-teach-extraordinarily:416f445d9bade50adf875443b512ceeb">How to Teach Extraordinarily</h1>

<p>The good news is that the standards of teaching in US universities are
so low in general, that it doesn&rsquo;t take much to be extraordinary.</p>

<p>Two simple steps are enough to get over that threshold:</p>

<ol>
<li>Respect your <strong>students&rsquo; time</strong>.</li>
<li>Focus on how you want to impact students <strong>five years from now</strong>, not
on what they can do sitting on an uncomfortable chair for a few hours at
the end of the semester.</li>
</ol>

<p>Most other things follow from these two premises.</p>

<h2 id="how-and-why-to-respect-students-time:416f445d9bade50adf875443b512ceeb">How (and Why) to Respect Students&rsquo; Time</h2>

<p>Respecting students should go without saying (or at least, it is said
frequently enough to be &ldquo;consensus advice&rdquo;), but the key to respecting
people is <em>respecting their time</em>.</p>

<p>The power imbalance between faculty and students leads to many faculty
behaving in ways that are tremendously disrespectful of students&rsquo; time
and getting away with it.  Sometimes professors seem to intentionally do
things to waste students&rsquo; time just to clarify how powerful and
important they are.  This is cruel and misguided.</p>

<p><strong>Come to Class Early.</strong> I&rsquo;ve observed many classes where the professor
  arrives a few minutes after the scheduled class time, fumbles around
  hooking up a laptop to a projector, searches for some slides to
  display, and finally gets class started several minutes late.
  Expecting dozens of students to sit around for several minutes waiting
  for class to start is not respectful of their time, and sends the
  dangerous message that you don&rsquo;t think class time is valuable.</p>

<p><strong>End Class On-Time (or Early).</strong> Going over the scheduled end-time is
  less bad than arriving too late to start on time, but similarly
  disrespectful of students&rsquo; time.  The way to end on time isn&rsquo;t to rush
  through whatever you thought you would cover that day to get to the
  end as you planned.  Instead, if you notice time is running low, <em>slow
  down</em>, find a reasonable place to stop before class time expires, and
  ask for questions.  I&rsquo;ve never heard anyone complain when a lecture or
  talk ends a bit early.</p>

<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t Assign Busywork.</strong> The point of assignments is to provide good
  conditions for students to learn interesting, valuable, and important
  things.  Don&rsquo;t assign tasks just to have something to grade.  Be
  flexible in your assignments, so students for whom the standard
  assignment would not be worthwhile can do something else.</p>

<p><img src="../images/balletclass.jpg" width="250" class="rightbar"></a>
<strong>Don&rsquo;t Be Oblivious.</strong> I took my two-year old daughter to a ballet
  class recently where the teacher started by telling us about her
  illustrious ballet career and then tried to teach the toddlers the
  ballet positions and have them follow complex directions holding onto
  a barre.  She was completely oblivious to the obvious fact that none
  of the toddlers were paying any attention to this and just wanted to
  run around, spinning in their tutus.  As a university teacher, your
  students are not nearly as good as the toddlers in providing immediate
  and clear feedback when what you are doing isn&rsquo;t appropriate.  But,
  they still provide fairly clear signs when things are off, and (unlike
  the toddlers) you can always stop and ask them what&rsquo;s wrong if it
  seems like no one is getting it.  If you don&rsquo;t get a useful response,
  maybe they are just tired, so ask them to stand up and move around
  (this works, even in large classes).</p>

<p><strong>Spend a Ridiculous Amount of Time Preparing Lectures.</strong><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:416f445d9bade50adf875443b512ceeb:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:416f445d9bade50adf875443b512ceeb:1">1</a></sup> The
  consensus advice (which I heard from many people, but also find
  <a href="http://americanfacultyassociation.blogspot.com/2012/02/hours-for-teaching-and-preparation-rule.html">written
  down</a>)
  is to spend about 2 hours of preparation time for each hour of class
  time.  This is probably good advice if your goal is to be squarely in
  the &ldquo;<a href="/evans/paradise/time/#how-to-be-mediocre-not:eefdcd66b28c2b86ef84bba398f2d59a">trough of mediocrity</a>&rdquo; (and, probably
  wasting time, since a lecture you spent 15-60 minutes preparing would
  probably get over the embarrassment threshold, and may well be better
  than the one you spend 2 hours preparing).</p>

<p>There may be some people who can prepare great lectures that quickly,
  but I have never been able to (and I hear similar things from everyone
  I know of who does great lectures).  I find that I need at least 10
  hours to prepare a new lecture I&rsquo;m not embarrassed by, and often 20-30
  hours to prepare one I consider good.  I find time spent preparing a
  lecture, especially on a topic that I don&rsquo;t already know much about,
  to be very fun and worthwhile.</p>

<p>I used to feel guilty about spending
  too much time preparing lectures, and was frequently told it was
  foolish to do this, but have concluded that spending sufficient time
  to prepare lectures that I&rsquo;m satisfied with is justified not just for
  selfish reasons of personal pride.  One way to justify it, at least in
  larger classes, is to divide your preparation time by the number of
  students in the class.  Spending 10 hours to prepare a lecture for a
  100-person class seems much more reasonable when viewed as 6 minutes
  per student.  <A href="http://www.jeffersonswheel.org/2009/hacking-the-world-cup-draw"><img src="../images/nytsports.jpg" width="250" class="rightbar"></a>
  It gets better if you amortize the cost of multiple iterations of the
  same course; it still takes quite a bit of time to prepare to &ldquo;reuse&rdquo;
  an old lecture (with improvements and adaptations), but a lot less
  than the time to prepare a new lecture.</p>

<p>Additional justification comes from making materials you prepare for
  your lectures available to an audience beyond just your class.  Many
  gratifying and unexpected things can come from this, ranging from
  other faculty finding and adapting your course materials to <a href="http://www.jeffersonswheel.org/2009/hacking-the-world-cup-draw">achieving
  your lifelong dream of making the sports pages of the <em>New York
  Times</em></a>.</p>

<p>Finally, aside from satisfying my own curiousty, it is also the case
  that I often get research ideas when preparing lectures on topics far
  afield from my normal research.</p>

<p>(I won&rsquo;t include anything here about actually developing lectures, but I
agree with most of the advice from <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/metatalk/"><em>Meta Talk: How to Give a Talk So
Good You&rsquo;ll Be Asked to Give Talks About
Nothing</em></a>.)</p>

<h2 id="how-to-have-long-term-impact:416f445d9bade50adf875443b512ceeb">How to Have Long-Term Impact</h2>

<p>If your goal is to just teach mediocre classes that get across some
material to your students, you should consider if your time would be
more effectively spent by holding office hours during the time you would
spend preparing and giving mediocre lectures, and encouring the students
to read and watch recorded classes rather than being bored in class.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:416f445d9bade50adf875443b512ceeb:2"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:416f445d9bade50adf875443b512ceeb:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Hopefully, you do want to be an extraordinary teacher, and that means
doing things that aim to have a more significant and longer term impact
on your students and the world beyond.  Achieving this is very rare, and
I can&rsquo;t claim to have a high success rate on this, but it is still worth
aspiring to since when it actually works out it is the most rewarding
and fulfilling thing you can do.</p>

<p><img src="../images/babymusicclass.jpg" width="250" class="rightbar">
<strong>Aspire to be <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/talks/smoochs/">more like baby music
  class</a> than a
  typical university lecture.</strong> Don&rsquo;t fall for all the hype about
  &ldquo;active learning&rdquo; and end up wasting most of class time with low-value
  activities, but realize that the traditional lecture model is a very
  challenging learning environment for most people.  Find ways to get
  students to move around, learn from each other, have fun, and work
  within students&rsquo; actual attention spans.</p>

<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t Teach to the &ldquo;Middle&rdquo;.</strong> Teaching to the middle gives everyone a
  mediocre experience.  You should aim to construct classes in a way
  that ensures everyone in the class gets the most important, biggest
  ideas, and that even the most advanced students are challenged by
  something every class.  One of the main challenges you face as a
  university teacher is finding a way to avoid losing or overwhelming
  the least advanced students, without making things boring for the most
  advanced ones.  Targeting the middle is the worst solution to this,
  serving no one in the class well.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-grade:416f445d9bade50adf875443b512ceeb">How to Grade</h2>

<p>Many professors spend a huge amount of time and stress on grading.  I
can think of few things less worthwhile to spend time on, but many
faculty fall into the trap of responding to student complaints about
grading being vague or unfair by adopting increasing painstaking and
demoralizing grading rubrics and complicated &ldquo;regrading&rdquo; protocols for
students and professors to spend time quibbling over points.</p>

<p>The point of grading is to provide students with useful feedback, not to
allocate and deduct points for trivial things.  There is no need to
grade every question, or figure out a detailed points-based grading
rubric.</p>

<p>I recommend this simple &ldquo;gold-star&rdquo; grading scale for most assignments: <a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/bush-earmarks-15-billion-gold-stars-for-education,392/"><img src="../images/onion.jpg" width="250" class="rightbar" border="1" alt="gold stars"></a></p>

</tbody>
</table>

<p>Inevitably, someone will ask what the &ldquo;average&rdquo; on an assignment was.<br />
It should be a murky goldish-greenish-silver star.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to limit expectations, though, so the top of the scale is unbounded:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/rich-firstgrader-buys-whole-sheet-of-gold-stars,3160/"><img border="1" src="../images/wholesheet.jpg" width="250" class="rightbar" alt="whole sheet"></a>Using a simple, star-based grading system will save you from lots of
unnecessary suffering and unpleasantness.</p>

<p>If you are worried that such a system will not provide enough
fine-grained data for you to adequately distinguish the B+, B, and B-
students at the end of the semester, you should reconsider whether or
not it is really so important for you to do that.  These differences
only matter to mediocre companies with misguided hiring practices, and
you should hope your students find more interesting places to work.</p>

<p>In introductory courses, there are three &ldquo;grades&rdquo; that matter:</p>

<ol>
<li>Identifying superstar students who you want to recruit to your research group.  (A+ final grade, and letter)</li>
<li>Sending a signal that students should take more classes in your discipline and consider it as a major. (A)</li>
<li>Indicating that a student put forth a reasonable effort, but is likely to find something else better suited to their talents and abilities. (B)</li>
<li>Lower grades for cases where students either demonstrated clear incompetence or unacceptable effort.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="for-whom-are-you-teaching:416f445d9bade50adf875443b512ceeb">For Whom Are You Teaching?</h2>

<p>Most people think this is a silly question &mdash; obviously, you are teaching
for the students sitting right in front of you.  But, that&rsquo;s the wrong
answer!</p>

<p>The students in your class are the most immediate victims or (hopefully)
beneficiaries of your teaching, but, at least if you are a faculty
member at an elite public university<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:416f445d9bade50adf875443b512ceeb:3"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:416f445d9bade50adf875443b512ceeb:3">3</a></sup>, they are not the primary
people you are teaching for.</p>

<p>Your salary is mostly not paid from those students&rsquo; tuition, and by
being able to attend your university, those students are already in the
lucky (and hopefuly deserving!) elite of society, nearly all of whom
will go on to lucrative and pleasant careers whether or not they took
your class.  The reason countries and states have public universities
(or provide public support to private ones), is not so a handful of
selected students can obtain some vocational training and earn a
recognized credential.  It is so some of those students go on to do
things that make the world a better place for everyone.</p>

<p>You should, of course, care about your students and want them to be
successful at individuals.  But, keep in mind that your real purpose is
to do things that serve the public at large.  This should predispose you
to make all of your teaching materials open (posted on public websites),
risk trying new things (even if there is some chance it will have
negative consequences for your current students), and invest in things
that will have long-term, external value even when it takes time away
from immediate value for your classroom students.</p>

<li id="fn:416f445d9bade50adf875443b512ceeb:1">I&rsquo;ve had the luxury of light teaching loads, where I am expected to teach at most one class a semester (and often only expected to teach a small seminar).  This is common for computer science faculty at research-focused universities, but may make my advice here seem unreasonable for someone who has to teach several courses at once.  I have a lot of sympathy for people with such heavy teaching loads, but don&rsquo;t really know how to manage this without making a lot of compromises.
