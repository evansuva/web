</div>

<p>As a new faculty member, you&rsquo;ll probably have scores of people wanting
to give you advice, not to mention documents like this one.  Getting
advice is easy, and giving advice is even easier than that, but figuring
out which advice to ignore is much harder.</p>

<p><div class="rightnote">
<a style="border-bottom:none;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150804111049/http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/the-awesomest-7-year-postdoc-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-tenure-track-faculty-life/"><img src="../images/rad-monkeys-2.jpg" width="220" height="190"></a>
Every new faculty member should read Radhika Nagpal&rsquo;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150804111049/http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/the-awesomest-7-year-postdoc-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-tenure-track-faculty-life/"><em>The Awesomest
7-Year Postdoc or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the
Tenure-Track Faculty
Life</em></a>. Her
first main realization is <b>&ldquo;I stopped taking advice&rdquo;</b>, which is advice you should
definitely follow!
   </div></p>

<h4 id="types-of-advice:7e88da48c1ab1067dbe244fe61fdff60">Types of Advice</h4>

<p>There are two main types of advice: <strong>consensus</strong> advice, which comes from
committees or similar well-vetted sources; and <strong>individual</strong> advice,
which is the mostly unfiltered view of a single person.</p>

<p>Consensus advice is usually <em>correct</em> (since lots of people agreed on
it), generally <em>agreeable</em> (no one on the committee objected to it), and
nearly always <em>uninteresting</em> (anything everyone agrees with is unlikely
to be nonobvious or surprising).</p>

<p>Individual advice is nearly always <em>wrong</em> (its just one arrogant
person&rsquo;s opinion), usually <em>disagreeable</em> (it is based only on their
personal circumstances and experience, and yours are certainly
different), but often <em>interesting</em> and <em>useful</em> (since some indvidual
felt strongly about it).</p>

<p>As an example, see if you can guess which of the recommendations below
came from a &ldquo;committee&rdquo; and which from an &ldquo;individual&rdquo;:
<table width="100%" cellpadding=10>
<tr>
<td valign="middle" width="64%" bgcolor="#FFFFAA">
<em>The truth is that no ideal strategy has yet been found, and that every
approach has strengths and weaknesses. Given the current state of the
art in this area, we are convinced that no one-size-fits-all approach
will succeed at all institutions. Because introductory programs differ
so dramatically in their goals, structure, resources, and intended
audience, we need a range of strategies that have been validated by
practice.</em></p>

<p>My meta-advice is that unless you feel particularly unprepared you
shouldn&rsquo;t waste much time on &ldquo;committee&rdquo; advice.  Everyone should,
however, <strong>read and listen to lots of advice from individuals</strong>, but
<strong>ignore most of it</strong>.</p>

<p>The two things you should think about in taking any advice are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How it applies to you &mdash; the person giving it has probably had very
different life experiences from you, and may even have different values
and goals.  You should be careful to weigh any advice you receive in
light of these differences.</p></li>

<li><p>Whether the person giving it has any incentives that don&rsquo;t align with
your own.  This mostly applies to advice you may receive from
administrators, whose goals or values may not be well-aligned with yours.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>See <a href="/paradise/others/">Other Advice</a> for links to some advice from
othe individuals that I think is particularly worth reading.</p>

<h3 id="why-you-shouldn-t-listen-to-me:7e88da48c1ab1067dbe244fe61fdff60">Why You Shouldn&rsquo;t Listen to Me</h3>

<p>Here are some reasons you probably shouldn&rsquo;t follow most of my advice
here:<img src="../images/lucky.jpg" width="250" height="253" class="rightbar" alt="lucky"></p>

<ol>
<li><p>I&rsquo;ve been <strong>extremely lucky</strong>.  Many of the things that have worked
out well for me could easily have been dismal failures if I hadn&rsquo;t been
so fortunate.</p></li>

<li><p>I started my professorial career back in 1999, when most things were
much easier than they are today.  I hope things haven&rsquo;t gotten much
worse for new faculty, but I fear that some major things have (at least
in computer security research and most other computing research areas,
things have certainly gotten more crowded).</p></li>

<li><p>I&rsquo;ve had the good fortune to spend my career in a growing field at a
wonderful university in a town that has been <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/27/happiness-place-called-charlottesville-virginia">scientifically proven to be the
happiest in all of the US</a>, recognized as <a href="http://www.thedailymeal.com/america-s-best-small-towns-food-2013-slideshow">America&rsquo;s best small town for food</a>, and as the <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/lifestyle/2004-03-29-best-cities-main_x.htm">best place to live in the US</a>.  That said, the experience of most faculty
at research-focused universities in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9XZSgDAtSQ"><em>endless golden-age
fields</em></a> has a fair bit in
common, so I think most of my experience is not that different from what
I&rsquo;ve heard others have experienced in similar fields.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.dori-mic.org"><img src="../images/dm-side-2.jpg"
width="250" height="224" class="rightbar" alt="Dori-Mic and the Universal
Machine"></img></a> I had no major personal responsibilities until long
after tenure (this was not by planning, but just the way things worked
out for me).  I hope those of you who have children earlier will still
be able to have a paradasical professorship, but I guess some things may
be a lot easier for me to say than they would be to do for people in
that scenario.  (I do have one small offering to help new professors
with young children.  One of the most stressful things I&rsquo;m sure you are
worrying about is how embarrassing it will be to you if your child ends
up behind other students in her kindergraten class in theoretical
computer science. Luckily, there is now <a href="http://www.dori-mic.org">a book to help with this</a>!)</p></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="why-you-might-listen:7e88da48c1ab1067dbe244fe61fdff60">Why You Might Listen</h3>

<p>That said, I do hope you are still willing to read on and perhaps listen
to some of my advice.  So, here are reasons why you might:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I&rsquo;m not a <a href="http://news.virginia.edu/content/master-teachers-called-spread-their-expertise-grounds">master
teacher</a>,
but I have taught over a half million students and learned a fair bit from many of them and a great deal from a handful of them.     <div id="imageblock">

<li><p>I believe in everything I&rsquo;ve written here strongly enough, that if you

super venti salted caramel mocha from Starbucks if you are into that
sort of thing) to discuss it further.</p></li>
