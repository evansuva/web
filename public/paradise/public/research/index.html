</div>

<p>By the time you have successfully completed a PhD, you should be
confident in your talents as a researcher.  You should feel comfortable
that you&rsquo;ve developed <strong>good taste</strong> for selecting research problems,
possess the <strong>tenacity to tackle hard challenges</strong> and see them through,
have <strong>mastered the important technical aspects</strong> of your field, and
have <strong>learned to present your work in writing and verbally</strong>.</p>

<p>If you are lacking confidence in those things, you should assume that
the people who hired you were not totally duped and that you are more
capable than you may realize.</p>

<p>The main new challenges you have as a professor are to <strong>raise
funding</strong>, to <strong>advise research students</strong>, and to <strong>avoid getting stuck
in a comfortable rut</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="how-to-raise-funds:42f623b3bad309d5d6619d450af47d40">How to Raise Funds</h1>

<p><img src="../images/pin-2.jpg" width="250" class="rightbar" alt="PIN"></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m putting fund-raising first, not because it is the most important
thing for new faculty, but it is the one thing nearly all new faculty
seem to be most worried about (but shouldn&rsquo;t be!).</p>

<p>Although you will face pressures from your administration to raise as
much money as possible, your actual goal should be to raise <em>enough</em>
money to be able to support the activities you want, and to raise that
money in ways that impose as little overhead (time spent doing things
you don&rsquo;t want to do) and constraints (lack of freedom in how you use
the funds) as possible.</p>

<p>For US-based researchers, this means funding from the National Science
Foundation and industry gifts.  You should consider any other funding
sources carefully; there are sometimes great opportunites to get funding
from other agencies or non-gift corporate funding, but be wary of the
overhead required.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:42f623b3bad309d5d6619d450af47d40:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:42f623b3bad309d5d6619d450af47d40:1">1</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="read-exemplary-proposals:42f623b3bad309d5d6619d450af47d40">Read Exemplary Proposals</h3>

<p><a name="funds">
<a href="./turing.html"><img class="rightbar" src="../images/turing-edit.jpg" width="250" alt="Turing"></a>
Nearly everyone starts their career as a researcher by reading exemplary
research papers and learning from them what makes a paper great.  Hardly
anyone ever reads exemplary proposals, largely because proposals tend to
be kept secret so it is hard to find ones to read.</p>

<p>I would encourage everyone to at least read the <a href="/paradise/turing/"><strong>proposal Alan Turing
and three colleagues at Bletchly Park wrote to Winston
Churchill</strong></a> to obtain support for cryptanalysis
work during World War II.  (I&rsquo;ve annotated the proposal with some
sidebar comments.)  This is quite different from what is needed for a
typical NSF proposal today, but there is still much to learn from it.</p>

<p>Finding more recent versions of proposals to read is tougher, but you
can read some of mine here (I wouldn&rsquo;t claim that they are &ldquo;exemplary&rdquo;,
but they did get funded; note that some of the specific rules of what
must be in an NSF proposal and how it must be formatted have changed
since these proposals):</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="write-fewer-proposals:42f623b3bad309d5d6619d450af47d40">Write Fewer Proposals</h3>

<p>Many new faculty seem to get the advice (especially from adminstrators
who benefit from their funding overhead charges!) to go after as many
funding opportunities as they can, and I&rsquo;ve known of new faculty who
submit over a dozen proposals a year (and one who bragged of submitting
over 100 proposals before going up for tenure!), including from low
quality funding sources.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/pictures/seattle/"><img src="../images/grumpyreviewer.jpg" width="250" class="rightbar"></a>
Sometimes this advice is given by well-meaning individuals who point to
low acceptance rates from NSF, and encourage faculty to submit lots of
proposals to hope one or two get lucky.  This would make sense if the
review process was really arbitrary, but its not.</p>

<p>NSF&rsquo;s proposal review process is done by panels of faculty recruited by
the Program Manager.  These reviewers (for the most part) take it very
seriously and have substantive discussions about the content of
proposals to decide what to recommend for funding.  Most panels meet for
an in-person two-day meeting in Arlington, although teleconference
panels are occasionaly used.  The panel reaches a consensus, and makes a
recommendation to the Program Manager, who then makes a recommendation
up the chain for which proposals should be funded.</p>

<p>From my experience (as both a submitter and panelist), at least, this
process works remarkably well.  In retrospect, think the correct
decision has been made for nearly every proposal I&rsquo;ve submitted in the
past 10 years, and although I have sometimes disagreed with
recommendations made by a panel I&rsquo;ve been on, all but one (of about 15
panels I&rsquo;ve been on) worked well and made decisions based on substantive
analysis of the merits of submitted proposals.</p>

<p>So, if you are being advised to submit lots of proposals because of low
acceptance rates reported for NSF programs, the correct response is to
submit fewer proposals, and to put better ideas and more effort into
each one to ensure it has a high likelihood of being funded.  Don&rsquo;t
submit a lot of proposals because you want to look productive (or are
told that&rsquo;s what you should do to be productive), or because you think
funding decisions are mostly arbitrary so your chances are maximized by
sending off lots of mediocre proposals.
   <div class="rightnote">
<em>In writing proposals to prospective clients, be sure to clearly state the benefits they will receive:
<b>WRONG:</b> &ldquo;I sincerely believe that it is to your advantage to accept this
proposal.&rdquo;
<b>RIGHT:</b> &ldquo;I have photographs of you naked with a squirrel.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/living/liv-columns-blogs/dave-barry/article1928613.html">Dave Barry&rsquo;s advice of writing proposals</a>
   </div></p>

<p>NSF funding decisions are much less random that those from even the best
program committees, and it is much better to submit one or two good
proposals a year than to try writing many mediocre ones.</p>

<h3 id="get-useful-feedback:42f623b3bad309d5d6619d450af47d40">Get Useful Feedback</h3>

<p>Part of writing fewer proposals is to have more time to get useful
feedback on each proposal before it is submitted.  Getting feedback
before submission is especially important for your first few proposals,
but even as an experienced proposal-writer, it is useful to see how well
your ideas come across in the proposal to someone unfamiliar with them.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t expect to get useful feedback from the actual reviews.  By the
time you get these, it will be at least six months after you submitted
the proposal, and they will be watered down to the point where it is
hard to know what the reviewers really felt.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:42f623b3bad309d5d6619d450af47d40:2"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:42f623b3bad309d5d6619d450af47d40:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>To get useful feedback, you need to have a fairly complete draft of the
proposal ready well before the deadline and get a colleague to read it
critically.  This needs to be done at least two weeks before the
deadline to give the reader enough time to read it, and leave enough
time for you to make substantial revisions in response (and possibly
even run the revised version by the reader before submission).</p>

<p>Hopefully, you have someone who can provide useful feedback to you on
your proposals.  If you&rsquo;ve read this far and have a fairly complete
proposal ready at least two weeks before the deadline, though, I&rsquo;m happy
to provide feedback on it (but may be of limited help depending on how
close you are to areas I know something about).</p>

<h1 id="how-and-why-to-advise:42f623b3bad309d5d6619d450af47d40">How (and Why) to Advise</h1>

<p>Following a world cup qualifying vicotory where two players he developed
for the national team subbed into the game and performed well, a
reporter asked coach J&uuml;rgen Klinsmann whether he was &ldquo;<em>lucky</em> or
<em>brilliant</em>&rdquo;.  His answer was that he felt <strong>&ldquo;proud&rdquo;</strong>.  The biggest
reward you get as an advisor is when you can feel proud of your student,
and you get to do this no matter if you were brilliant or lucky!</p>

<p>The biggest challenge you have as a new professor is that your
experience with research advising is probably limited to what you
experienced with your own PhD advisor (and perhaps a few other research
supervisors).  This is hopefully a good and valuable experience, but you
should be wary of thinking you know how to advise students by doing what
your advisor did for you.</p>

<p>You were a unique and exceptional student, so the way your advisor
advised you is almost certainly the wrong way for you to advise your
students!</p>

<h3 id="nano-manage-or-deci-manage-but-never-micro-manage:42f623b3bad309d5d6619d450af47d40">Nano-manage or Deci-manage, but never Micro-manage</h3>

<p>The main thing you need to decide is how much freedom you want do give
your students.  Ideally, all of your students will be brilliant, wise,
self-motivated, and posessing uncanny judgement.  For such students,
<em>deci-management</em> is the best option.  Provide a few pointers to things
that you think are interesting, give feedback on the ideas the student
comes up with, and help with the finer points of how to present the work
effectively.  But, otherwise, give the student as much space and little
management as possible.</p>

<p>In other situations, <em>nano-management</em> may be better.  This means
working closely with the student, perhaps even working together on part
of a project (for me, this is most common with writing, but can be
appropriate for design and programming also).  It is very worthwhile to
go through work in great detail, providing feedback and suggestions at a
low-level.</p>

<p>For most students, a mix of deci-management and nano-management is best.
I don&rsquo;t know of any students for whom deci-management was the best
approach for their entire PhD process, and any student who needs to be
nano-managed for more than a few short periods during their PhDship is
probably better off pursuing a different career.</p>

<p>Micro-management is the worst possible strategy.  It gives the managee
so much direction that they are left with no opportunity for creativity
or (positive) surprise, but not enough direction to make the likelihood
of failure low and not enough collaboration to be a good learning
experience.  I don&rsquo;t think anyone enjoys being micromanaged, and if you
enjoy being a micromanager you should find a job at a large, established
company.</p>

<p>Your aim as an advisor should be to develop your students into research
leaders.  This means by the time they graduate they have the ability and
confidence needed to identify good problems to work on on their own and
can carry out all aspects of doing the research, including presenting
it.  If you micromanage your students, they may be more productive and
appear more successful, but won&rsquo;t develop what they need to succeed as
an independent research leader.</p>

<h1 id="how-to-avoid-ruts:42f623b3bad309d5d6619d450af47d40">How to Avoid Ruts</h1>

<p>It may be strange to focus on avoiding ruts in advice for new faculty
members, but falling into a rut is one of the main dangers you face.</p>

<p>The most comfortable thing to do as a new professor is to keep working
on the same kinds of things you did for your dissertation, and its easy
and common to fall into the trap of spending your whole career doing
essentially the same thing over and over.  For some people, this may be
the right decision.  There are many researchers who I greatly respect
who have devoted their full careers to one problem and developed a line
of research that was a sustained effort in a consistent direction to
tackle that problem.  If you are convinced that the problem you are
working on is the most interesting one, and that the approach you take
is the best way you can contribute to it, its fine to spend your whole
career focused in that way.  But, this should be a conscious decision,
not something you fall into accidentally by just making a series of
&ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; decisions until it is too hard to try something different.</p>

<p><div class="rightnote">
<em>Reward a person for doing something, and they&rsquo;ll want to keep doing
it. If the reward continues for long enough, they&rsquo;ll keep doing that
thing indefinitely unless something stops them.  This is pretty simple
stuff. Of course, anyone would want to keep doing something that they&rsquo;re
rewarded for. That might take the form of money, praise, social status,
power, impressive-sounding titles, or many other things. But if the
rewards keep flowing without interruption, we can end up like the rat
that keeps pressing a lever in some laboratory &mdash; repetitive and
dull. And it&rsquo;s worth keeping in mind that just because you happen to be
very, very good at pressing that lever, that doesn&rsquo;t make you an
interesting rat. You&rsquo;re just a dull rat with one, highly specialized
skill.</em><br />

</div></p>

<p><strong>Switch Areas Frequently.</strong> For most researchers, the best course is to
find new areas that you find interesting, and which you can bring a
different perspective to.  If you work on the same problems with similar
background and perspective as everyone else, the only way you can do
something significant is if you are smarter, harder-working, and luckier
than others.  Changing focus is uncomfortable though &mdash; working in
a new area requires abandoning all the experience and knowledge you have
in your current area and learning about something new.  The good news in
computer science, at least, is that our field is immature enough that in
most areas it only takes a few months to get sufficiently up-to-speed to
start making research contributions.</p>

<p>It is also beneficial if you can vary the problems and approaches you
take without needing to abandon your research community (where a
research community is mostly defined by a set of conferences that
attract a common group of people).  As a new professor, it is important
that you build your reputation and get to know a core group of people in
a particular research community.  One of the great things about being in
the security and privacy research community is that you can work in
almost all areas of computer science without being disconnected from a
primary research community.  This is probably harder in other research
communities, but not impossible.</p>

<p><strong>Be First or Last.</strong> Aim to write either the <em>first</em> paper on <em>X</em>, or
  the <em>last</em> paper on <em>Z</em>.  You&rsquo;ll have a lot more impact by doing this,
  than by writing the 23<sup>rd</sup>, 26<sup>th</sup>, 87<sup>th</sup>,
  and 193<sup>rd</sup> papers on some well-studied topic.  If you find
  yourself working in an area that is so crowded, you more worried about
  getting scooped by someone else doing the same thing, its time to
  switch areas.  Much better to be working on something where you are
  happy to find one or two like-minded colleagues to collaborate with,
  than something where you feel the need to be secretive about your
  latest incremental advance for fear that others are doing something
  similar and you are in a race to publish first.</p>

<p><strong>Find and Empower Creative Students.</strong> One of the best ways to avoid
  getting stuck in ruts, is to ensure that you keep working with new
  people who bring different ideas and perspectives from your own.
  Collaborations with other professors and senior researchers can do
  this, but (at least in my experience) such collaborations are very
  difficult beyond efforts to write funding proposals except when they
  are driven by a student.  The best way to continually refresh your
  research is to allow students to drive you into new areas.  Don&rsquo;t be
  afraid to let students work on things you don&rsquo;t know much about, just
  expect them to enough to convince you it is worthwhile and
  interesting.</p>

<li id="fn:42f623b3bad309d5d6619d450af47d40:1">DARPA programs typically require PIs to attend at least four PI meetings every year, some as many as six), reports (e.g., some funding requires monthly reports), and constraints (e.g., many DoD awards require strict adherance to a &ldquo;Statement of Work&rdquo;, and the people who check-off that you do what is on that list tend to not be researchers so are not easy to convince that a new idea is better than what was originally proposed).  This is why research groups (and companies) that fall into the trap of taking such funding, end up spending most of their effort managing DARPA, rather than actually doing research.
