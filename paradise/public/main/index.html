<p>Paul Graham <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/college.html">once wrote</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Almost everyone hates their dissertation by the time they&rsquo;re done with it. The process inherently
  tends to produce an unpleasant result, like a cake made out of whole
  wheat flour and baked for twelve hours. Few dissertations are read
  with pleasure, especially by their authors.</em></p>

<p><em>And aside from that, grad school is <strong>close to paradise</strong>. Many people
  remember it as the happiest time of their lives. And nearly all the
  rest, including me, remember it as a period that would have been, if
  they hadn&rsquo;t had to write a dissertation.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a professor reading this now, you&rsquo;ve most likely finished your
dissertation already and know enough algebra to reach the obvious
conclusion:</p>

<p><center><img src="./images/algebra-small.png" align=center"
alt="gradstuent+dissertation=paradise" width="550" border=0></center></p>

<p>Despite the apparent correctness of my algebra, I encounter many young
professors who are stressed and unhappy, and many older ones who are
miserable and bitter.</p>

<p><em>How can this be</em>?</p>

<p>The traditional view of paradise is sitting on a quiet Carribbean beach
while scantily clad attractive young people of your preferred gender
bring a steady stream of fancy drinks with umbrellas in them, with
nothing to do but watch the waves on the beach and permanent sunset.</p>

<p>This could be good for a few days a year, but as a permanent life sounds
quite horrifying!</p>

<p><strong>True paradise is being able to do things you find personally,
intellectually, and socially gratifying.</strong></p>

<p>No job provides a better freedom and opportunity to do this than being a
professor.  So, <em>if being a professor is making you miserable, you must
be doing something wrong!</em></p>

<p><a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/photos/114975801512009922265/albums/5692195893088532193/5692197259652743330?pid=5692197259652743330&oid=114975801512009922265">

If you&rsquo;re not convinced that you are in paradise yet, consider how
idyllic and unimaginable your job would seem to anyone who has a <em>real</em>
job: you get paid a generous salary for having the freedom to work on
anything you want, whenever you want, and however you want, with no boss
to report to, no time cards to punch, and (essentially<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:379caad01b6ea305187be199bcac1370:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:379caad01b6ea305187be199bcac1370:1">1</a></sup>) no risk of
getting fired no matter what you do.</p>

<p>Beyond that, you get to work with smart and interesting people, and can
choose whomever you want to work with from both your own institution and
its &ldquo;competitors&rdquo;.  You get the opportunity to teach, interact with, and
potentially inspire generations of creative and ambitious students.  You
lack any serious responsibilities or burdens of command, and don&rsquo;t have
to make any life-or-death decisions.  You can fail without serious
consequences, and its fine if you change your mind about what you want
to do.  And, if you get bored, you can go do something else for a year
or more (and even keep getting part of your salary!), safe in the
knowledge that you can return to your cushy academic position.</p>

<p>That sounds like the <a href="http://yourstory.in/2013/10/david-evans-udacity/">best job in the world to
me</a>, and I hope it
does to you too!  If you don&rsquo;t see this as an imaginably privileged and
marvelous existence you should quit now and open up a position for
someone who is likely to make better use of it.</p>

<li id="fn:379caad01b6ea305187be199bcac1370:1">I know of a dean at an unnamed prestigious university claimed that the difference between a professor without tenure and one with tenure is that firing the one without tenure takes one phone call, but he needs two calls to fire the one with tenure.  The reality is, though, as long as a tenured professor doesn&rsquo;t do something to upset a major donor or put the institution at legal risk, they are exceedingly unlikely to be fired.
