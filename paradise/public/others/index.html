<p><a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/evans/advice/prospective.html">Advice for Prospective Research Students on Contacting Potential Advisors</a>
   <div class="icomment">
Mostly not relevant for new faculty, but you may want to have a similar
page with your suggestions for students to contact you.  It saves a lot
of time to be able to point people who send you emails to a URL.  (This
is actually the most visited page on my personal website, getting
several thousand visits a month.)</p>

<p></div></p>

<p><a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/evans/talks/metatalk/">Advice on Giving Talks</a>
   <div class="icomment"></p>

<p>One of the hardest things about becoming a professor is it gets much
harder to get any real feedback on talks (unlike your students, who
should be frequently giving talks and getting a lot of feedback from you
on them).  If you can find a mentor who can give you useful feedback on
talks (including lectures), you are very lucky and should take advantage
of this.</p>

<p></div></p>

<p><a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/evans/advice">Collected Advice for Students</a>
   <div class="icomment">
Some of what is collected there is duplicated here, but the <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/lab/tipping.html"><em>Academic Tipping Guidelines</em></a> only apply to students.

<h3 id="advice-for-new-faculty:77923aeb530cb6e499cb0ad0da0096f1">Advice for New Faculty</h3>

<p>This essay was largely inspired by Radhika Nagpal&rsquo;s excellent essay
<a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2013/07/21/the-awesomest-7-year-postdoc-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-tenure-track-faculty-life/"><em>The Awesomest 7-Year Postdoc or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and
Love the Tenure-Track Faculty
Life</em></a>.
I didn&rsquo;t do a post-doc, though, and believe most post-docs are very far
from paradise, so have a somewhat different perspective than she does
(although we were classmates as undergraduates!).</p>

<h3 id="research:77923aeb530cb6e499cb0ad0da0096f1">Research</h3>

<p>Richard Hamming&rsquo;s advice on doing great research: <a
href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hamming.html"><em>You and Your
Research</em></a> (Talk at Bellcore, 7 March 1986)
   <div class="excerpt">
Over on the other side of the dining hall was a chemistry table. I had
worked with one of the fellows, Dave McCall; furthermore he was courting
our secretary at the time. I went over and said, &ldquo;Do you mind if I join
you?&rdquo; They can&rsquo;t say no, so I started eating with them for a while. And
I started asking, &ldquo;What are the important problems of your field?&rdquo; And
after a week or so, &ldquo;What important problems are you working on?&rdquo; And
after some more time I came in one day and said, &ldquo;If what you are doing
is not important, and if you don&rsquo;t think it is going to lead to
something important, why are you at Bell Labs working on it?&rdquo; I wasn&rsquo;t
welcomed after that; I had to find somebody else to eat with!&hellip;</p>

<p>If you do not work on an important problem, it&rsquo;s unlikely you&rsquo;ll do
important work&hellip;<br />
   </div>
   <div class="rightnote">
This line is frequently quoted (included in <a
href="http://gradschool.unc.edu/events/hooding/2012/">Levoy&rsquo;s talk</a>),
and seems obviously right, but I think its wrong and dangerous!  Much
better to work on obviously fun problems, than obviously important
ones.  See <a
href="http://scienceblogs.com/thescian/2008/03/11/what-are-worthwhile-problems-f/">Richard
Feynman&rsquo;s letter to Koichi Mano</a> for a better perspective on this.
   </div></p>

<p>Marc Levoy&rsquo;s <a href="http://gradschool.unc.edu/events/hooding/2012/"><em>Where do
 disruptive ideas come from?</em></a> (hooding ceremony speech at the
 University of North Carolina)
   <div class="excerpt">
For three years I lived next door to Facebook. Literally next door. I
 could throw a rock from my bedroom window and break a window in Mark
 Zuckerberg&rsquo;s office. They have a particular culture at Facebook: young,
 edgy, in-your-face. Their walls are covered with graffiti and posters,
 spray-painted in Wild West Wanted-dead-or-alive font. One of them says:
 &ldquo;Move fast, break things.&rdquo;  Their offices have concrete floors, no
 interior walls and lots of skateboards, so I imagine they do break
 things.  My favorite poster says, &ldquo;What would you do if you weren&rsquo;t
 afraid?&rdquo;  Being afraid is useful. On the savannah it kept us from being
 eaten by lions. Nevertheless, this is the message I&rsquo;d like to leave you
 with, the same message my mentor Don Greenberg gave to me. Know your
 fears, know also what you really want, weigh the odds, and
 occasionally, make a run for it.<br />

href="http://jcs.biologists.org/content/121/11/1771.full"><em>The
importance of stupidity in scientific research</em></a>
<div class="excerpt">
We don&rsquo;t do a good enough job of teaching our students how to be
productively stupid &mdash; that is, if we don&rsquo;t feel stupid it means
we&rsquo;re not really trying.
</div></p>

<h3 id="writing:77923aeb530cb6e499cb0ad0da0096f1">Writing</h3>

<p>Marc Raibert&rsquo;s advice on <a
href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pausch/Randy/Randy/raibert.htm"><em>Good Writing</em></a>
   <div class="excerpt">
My formula for good writing is simple: once you decide that you want to
produce good writing and that you can produce good writing, then all
that remains is to write bad stuff, and to revise the bad stuff until it
is good.
   </div></p>

<p>Stephen Pinker&rsquo;s <a
href="http://chronicle.com/article/Why-Academics-Writing-Stinks/148989/"><em>Why
Academics&rsquo; Writing Stinks</em></a> [<a href="pinker.pdf">PDF with more commentary</a>]
   <div class="excerpt">
Academics mindlessly cushion their prose with wads of fluff that imply
they are not willing to stand behind what they say. Those include
almost, apparently, comparatively, fairly, in part, nearly, partially,
predominantly, presumably, rather, relatively, seemingly, so to speak,
somewhat, sort of, to a certain degree, to some extent, and the
ubiquitous I would argue. (Does that mean you would argue for your
position if things were different, but are not willing to argue for it now?)
   </div></p>

<p>Terence Tao&rsquo;s <a
href="http://terrytao.wordpress.com/advice-on-writing-papers/">advice on
writing papers</a> including <a
href="http://terrytao.wordpress.com/advice-on-writing-papers/use-the-introduction-to-%E2%80%9Csell%E2%80%9D-the-key-points-of-your-paper/">introductions</a>:
   <div class="excerpt">
This can be as much the fault of the author as it is of the referee; it
is incumbent on the author to state as clearly as possible what the
merits, novelties, and ramifications of the paper are, and the fact that
an expert in the field could read the introduction and not see these is
a sign that the introduction is not yet of publication quality.
   </div></p>

<p>Dave Barry&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/living/liv-columns-blogs/dave-barry/article1928613.html">advice on writing proposals</a>:
   <div class="excerpt">
In writing proposals to prospective
clients, be sure to clearly state the benefits they will receive:
<blockquote>
<b>WRONG:</b> &ldquo;I sincerely believe that it is to your advantage to accept this
proposal.&rdquo;
<p>
<b>RIGHT:</b> &ldquo;I have photographs of you naked with a squirrel.&rdquo;
</blockquote>
   </div></p>

<p>James Altucher&rsquo;s <a
href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2011/03/33-unusual-tips-to-being-a-better-writer/"><em>33
Unusual Tips to Being a Better Writer</em></a>:
   <div class="excerpt">
<b>Use a lot of periods.</b> Forget commas and semicolons. A period makes
people pause. Your sentences should be strong enough that you want
people to pause and think about it.  This will also make your sentences
shorter. Short sentences are good.
   </div></p>

<p>Geoffrey Pullman&rsquo;s anti-dote to Strunk &amp;
White: <a href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~gpullum/LandOfTheFree.pdf"><em>The
Land of the Free and The Elements of Style</em> [PDF]</a>.
   <div class="excerpt">
The book&rsquo;s style advice, largely vapid and obvious (&ldquo;Do not overwrite&rdquo;;
&ldquo;Be clear&rdquo;), may do little damage; but the numerous statements about
grammatical correctness are actually harmful. They are riddled with
inaccuracies, uninformed by evidence, and marred by bungled analysis.
Elements is a dogmatic bookful of bad usage advice, and the people who
rely on it have no idea how badly off-beam its grammatical claims are.
   </div></p>

<p>Greg Mankiw also has some great advice on <a
href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/10/how-to-write-well.html"><em>How
to Write Well</em></a> (a few of the points are specific to economics, since
the advice was written for his staff preparing the Economic Report of
the President, but nearly all of it is good advice for all writing).
(Geoffrey
Pullman <a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=18345">is not a
  fan</a>, though.)
   <div class="excerpt">
The passive voice is avoided by good writers.<br>
The word &ldquo;very&rdquo; is very often very unnecessary.

<p>Paul Lockhart&rsquo;s advice on teaching (focused on teaching mathematics, but
applies to all teaching): <a
href="http://radian.org/~krstic/LockhartsLament.pdf"><em>Lockhart&rsquo;s
Lament</em></a> [PDF]
   <div class="excerpt">
Teaching is not about information. It&rsquo;s about having an honest
intellectual relationship with your students. It requires no method, no
tools, and no training. Just the ability to be real. And if you can&rsquo;t be
real, then you have no right to inflict yourself upon innocent children.
&hellip;
It may be true that you have to be able to read in order to fill out
forms at the DMV, but that&rsquo;s not why we teach children to read. We
teach them to read for the higher purpose of allowing them access to
beautiful and meaningful ideas.
