</div>

<p>The most important decisions you make are how to use your time.  Use your time in a way that <strong>reflects your values.</strong></p>

<p>Deciding what you value is a difficult and important question, and I
can&rsquo;t presume to tell you what the answer should be for you.  I do
believe, though, that everyone who becomes a professor in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9XZSgDAtSQ">endless
golden-age field</a> shares at
least these three core values:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>People matter.</strong>  It is rewarding and gratifying to do things that
have a positive impact on other people, and painful to do things that
are harmful to other people.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Knowlege matters.</strong> The future should be better than the present,
just like the present is better than the past.  The vast majority of
human lives have been massively improved by scientific and technological
progress.  Contributing to and sharing that progress is a worthy and
noble endeavour.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Freedom matters.</strong> Being able to do, say, and think what you want
is valuable and important, as is empowering and enabling others to be
free.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Once you figure out what you value, you should aim to spend your time in
ways that are consistent with those values, both in the short-term and
long-term.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll hear advice from many people on how to achieve <em>Work-Life
Balance</em><sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:eefdcd66b28c2b86ef84bba398f2d59a:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:eefdcd66b28c2b86ef84bba398f2d59a:1">1</a></sup>, but &ldquo;Work-Life&rdquo; balance is a ridiculous goal!</p>

<p><center><img src="../images/worklife.gif"></center></p>

<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t aim to <em>balance</em> work and life.  Your life is everything.
The only thing that matters is your personal mental and physical health
and that of your family and close friends.  You should aim to make your
work a fulfilling and meaningful part of your life, not something to
balance against it.</p>

fortunately I&rsquo;m not smart enough to have to worry about that (and
probably you aren&rsquo;t either).</p>

   <em>The couples with which Sandberg is familiar seem to be ones in which nannies and cleaners do most of the household and child-related work. &hellip; The authors cite a couple in Massachusetts that I actually know. The mom is a bigshot at a non-profit organization. The dad is a child psychiatrist who, according to Sandberg, “leaned in” to do far more than the traditional male share of child rearing. Perhaps he did, but this couple has twins that are about the same age as Greta, my 3.5-year-old, so I see the kids a lot. Of the 50 or so times that I’ve seen the twins, were they with mom or dad? Once they were with mom. Once they were with both parents. 48 times they were with a Brazilian nanny.</em><br />

   </div></p>

<p>The conclusion to draw from this, though, is not that you shouldn&rsquo;t
<em>work</em> at all, but that you should do <em>work</em> only insofar as it
contributes to your <em>life</em>.  For most people, this should mean doing
work that is beneficial for your personal fulfillment and self-respect
as well as for making your family proud to be related to you, and to
hopefully be the role model you want for your children.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:eefdcd66b28c2b86ef84bba398f2d59a:2"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:eefdcd66b28c2b86ef84bba398f2d59a:2">2</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="how-much-should-you-work:eefdcd66b28c2b86ef84bba398f2d59a">How Much Should You Work</h2>

<p>To most of humanity, <em>work</em> is the stuff you do solely because if you
didn&rsquo;t your employer might fire you.  By this definition, as a professor
you should aim to work no more than 10 hours a year, and ideally reduce
that number to zero if possible.</p>

<p>For me, the main work I do each year is filling out the asinine annual
report forms our school requires.  There are two separate forms to
submit for this.  The first is a <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/evans/docs/seas-annual.docx">painfully long Word
document</a> that
requires fitting lots of text into strangely formatted boxes to answer
awkwardly-posed questions that reflect poorly on the Dean&rsquo;s values and
competence (e.g., &ldquo;List courses in which you incorporated new teaching
techniques (e.g., inclusion of computing, use of multimedia equipment,
etc.)&ldquo;) as well as a final page meant to quantify one&rsquo;s value by
counting things like &ldquo;Copyrighted software&rdquo;.
   <div class="rightnote">
  <em>Don&rsquo;t be afraid of work.  Make work afraid of you. I did such a fabulous job of making work afraid of me that it has avoided me my whole life so far.</em><br />
   <a href="http://www.cartalk.com/blogs/staff-blog/tom-magliozzi-1937-2014">Tom Magliozzi</a>
   </div></p>

<p>The second is a one-page form where you have to self-rate yourself
according to a rubric that has been plainstakingly devised by an endless
series of committees.  As an example, here&rsquo;s the teaching rubric:</p>

<p><center><img src="../images/seas-rubric.jpg" width=640></center></p>

<p>Note that the teaching rubric doesn&rsquo;t include even a single item that
has anything to do with the faculty member is actually doing anything
that contributes to <em>students actually learning</em>, but the only thing one
needs to do to move up from &ldquo;Does Not Meet Expectations&rdquo; to &ldquo;Partially
Meets Expectations&rdquo; is to cancel classes!  Happily, this is enough to be
satisfactory as far as the school is concerned, so as long as faculty
notice the rubric with at least two classes left in the semester in time
to cancel them, there is no risk of obtaining an unsatisfactory teaching
rating.</p>

<p>Filling out these forms takes about 4-10 hours of soul-crushing work to
complete.  More principled faculty than me refuse to fill these in, but
since faculty who fail to submit them are not considered for raises, it
seems worth it to me to cynically spend the time it requires each year
to do this.  The suffering it involves is at least somewhat balanced by
the realization that I have to do this for a few hours each year, but
many people have jobs where their entire job is doing similarly
soul-crushing work!</p>

<p>Aside from filling in the annual report for the school, the other main
work I do each year is financial administration and reporting for my
research grants.  I avoid as much as possible grants with high
administrative requirements (such as those from DARPA or IARPA), so this
typically requires only a few hours per year (about an hour per $100,000
spent, which seems pretty reasonable, and the financial administration
staff in our department does a great job of taking care of most of the
hard parts).</p>

<h2 id="how-to-spend-the-rest-of-your-time:eefdcd66b28c2b86ef84bba398f2d59a">How to Spend the Rest of Your Time</h2>

<p>Other than the 10-20 hours per year that you have to work, for the rest
of your time you have essentially complete freedom how you spend it.
That freedom comes with some obligation to spend your time in ways that
benefit humanity, but very few other constraints or obligations.  This
is one of the best things about being a professor, but is something very
few faculty seem to take much advantage of.</p>

<p><img src="../images/mattercount.jpg" width="250" height="193" class="rightbar" alt="matter vs. count">
Tenure-track faculty often complicate things by thinking there is a
dilemma between spending time on &ldquo;things that matter&rdquo; and &ldquo;things that
<em>count</em>&rdquo; for getting tenure.  Contrary to what many new faculty believe,
there is no secret list of &ldquo;countable&rdquo; things that is hidden in a deep
corner of Tenureville (at least, if there is, I haven&rsquo;t yet reach a
sufficient depth to gain access to it).</p>

<p>Getting tenure is just about convincing 12-25 people who have it that
you deserve it.  Fortunately, most of those people should have values
that are well-aligned with yours, so if you focus on doing things that
matter well that should be enough for them.  The others are either
people who feel like they endured a certain amount of suffering doing
silly things to get tenure so want to make sure everyone else does (in
other domains this is called <em>hazing</em>), or administrators whose values
may have been corrupted by many years away from paradise.  You should
hope that such people will be convinced by the others, or at least,
won&rsquo;t have power over them.  But, rest assured that even if you don&rsquo;t
get tenure, if you&rsquo;ve focused on things that matter you will have plenty
of good options of other things to do.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-be-mediocre-not:eefdcd66b28c2b86ef84bba398f2d59a">How to Be Mediocre (Not!)</h2>

<p>It natural to think there is a linear relationship to the amount of
energy expended on something and the quality or value of the result, but
the reality is much different.  For most things professors do, it looks
something like this:</p>

<p><center><img src="../images/mediocrity.png" align="center" width="640" height="310"></center></p>

<p>It takes a farily minimal amount of effort to cross the <em>threshold of
non-embarrassment</em>, but effort beyond that if unlikely to create much
added value, until really significant energy is put into something to
reach the level of <em>observably extraordinarinary</em>.  For many tasks, its not
even clear if extra effort improves value for most of the middle range.</p>

<p>So, to manage your time most effectively without risking embarrassment,
you should do enough to just cross the threshold of non-embarrassment
for all but the tasks you are most passionate about, and reserve all the
energy you can to devote to those.</p>

<p>Ideally, you would avoid taking on any tasks that you don&rsquo;t feel
strongly enough about to want to reach the pinnacle of
extraordinariness.  But, you may take on more than you end up having
time for and have to triage.  In such cases, much better to identify one
thing to reach for extraordinariness on and just aim to cross the
non-embarrassment threshold on everything else, rather than to end up
doing everything in a mediocre way.  It is also the case that even tasks
that you feel strongly about (e.g., teaching) are often composed of
several subtasks, many of which are neither exciting nor terribly
important (e.g., grading) but can be huge time-killers if you get
trapped striving to move through the trough of mediocrity.  Focus on the
subtasks you care most about and are uniquely able to contribute to, and
aim do the rest at just about the embarrassment level.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-manage-time:eefdcd66b28c2b86ef84bba398f2d59a">How to Manage Time</h2>

<p>The best advice I&rsquo;ve seen on time management is Randy Pausch&rsquo;s lecture
(see <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Randy/">Gabe Robins&rsquo; site for more background on
Randy</a>):</p>

<p><center>
<iframe width="640" height="480" src="http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oTugjssqOT0?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</center></p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have much to add to Randy&rsquo;s talk, which I would encourage
everyone to watch, but mention a few specific things I&rsquo;ve learned below.</p>

<h4 id="how-to-avoid-telephone-interruptions:eefdcd66b28c2b86ef84bba398f2d59a">How to Avoid Telephone Interruptions</h4>

<p>Don&rsquo;t have an <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/evans/phone/">office telephone</a>.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:eefdcd66b28c2b86ef84bba398f2d59a:3"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:eefdcd66b28c2b86ef84bba398f2d59a:3">3</a></sup></p>

<h4 id="how-to-schedule-and-be-scheduled:eefdcd66b28c2b86ef84bba398f2d59a">How to Schedule and Be Scheduled</h4>

<p>One of the most essential but hardest things to do is to rigorously
block off time for important things.  If you start with a blank
calendar, and fill it up with meetings, leaving the remaining time for
important stuff, there is a big risk that you end up with no time left
for anything important.</p>

<p>You should instead start by putting all the really important things on
your calendar:</p>

<ol>
<li>Family time.</li>
<li>Time to exercise.</li>
<li>Time for reading, thinking, and creating.</li>
<li>Time for fun/relaxing.</li>
</ol>

<p>Block our real entries on your calendar with as much time as you need
for these, and treat them like <strong>real appointments</strong>.  You might need to
reschedule them occasionally, but don&rsquo;t just cancel them to make room
for inessential meetings!</p>

<p><div class="rightnote">
   <em>Be ruthless about protecting writing days, i.e., do not cave in to
endless requests to have &ldquo;essential&rdquo; and &ldquo;long overdue&rdquo; meetings on
those days. The funny thing is that, although writing has been my actual
job for several years now, I still seem to have to fight for time in
which to do it. Some people do not seem to grasp that I still have to
sit down in peace and write the books, apparently believing that they
pop up like mushrooms without my connivance. I must therefore <strong>guard the
time allotted to writing as a Hungarian Horntail guards its firstborn
egg.</strong></em><br />

    </div></p>

<p>Then, schedule your classes, meetings with students, research meetings,
and with anytime leftover, any other meetings you think are more
worthwhile than having extra time for family or thinking.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found it useful to ask all of my research students to respond to a
<a href="http://whenisgood.net">whenisgood.net</a> request to provide me their
regular schedule, and use this to schedule both regular and irregular
meetings.</p>

<h4 id="how-and-why-to-take-vacations:eefdcd66b28c2b86ef84bba398f2d59a">How (and Why) to Take Vacations</h4>

<p><img class="rightbar" src="../images/ready.jpg" width="250" alt="ready">
   <div class="rightcaption" style="margin-top:5px;">Getting Ready for a Productive Research Day</div>
   </img></p>

<p>Unlike &ldquo;real&rdquo; jobs, as a professor you can effectively take as much
vacation as you want, whenever you want (except when you have classes to
teach).  Despite this, most professors seem to never or rarely take
vacations.</p>

<p>If you suffer from this, the way to get over it is to realize that your
main goal as a researcher is to come up with <strong>one or two good ideas a
year</strong>, and a <strong>great idea every decade</strong>.  You are much more likely to come
up with those good-great ideas if you are relaxed, in a new environment,
and having time to daydream, sleep well, and have new experiences, than
if you are stressed out in your office trying to appear productive.</p>

<p>The main reason most professors don’t take enough vacations is because
of the excessive fear they have that while they are vacationing, their
rivals will be working hard so by vacationing they are putting the
career at a disadvantage and if they are choosing problems to work on
foolishly, perhaps even putting themselves in danger of being scooped.</p>

<p>The solution to this is to make everyone take vacations.  The Puritans
accomplished this by imposing fines and whippings on anyone caught
working on the sabbath, but such penalties are hard to enforce today.</p>

<p><div class="rightnote"> <p><br></br></p>
<em>Profanation of the Lord&rsquo;s Day shall be punished by fine, imprisonment, or corporeal punishment; and if proudly, and with a high hand against the authority of God&ndash;with death.</em><br />

   </div></p>

<p>To allay any guilt you might have just taking vacations for their own
sake, I encourage you to observe important these universal holidays:

<li id="fn:eefdcd66b28c2b86ef84bba398f2d59a:1">This website is based on a talk I first gave at the <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity14/birds-feather-sessions#colloquium">Doctoral Colloquim at USENIX Security Symposium 2014</a> which was followed by a panel on &ldquo;Work-Life Balance&rdquo; (which ran until after 9pm on an evening during the conference).

The third, thankfully, was at least somewhat on the fence about having a life being a good thing, but early enough in her career to be unsure how compatible this was with being a professor.

It is probably not necessary to work at all to do this, though, in <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/02/poverty-in-america-is-mainstream/?src=me&amp;ref=general">semi-developed countries like the United States</a> (and certainly not in fully-developed countries like Canada) that are rich and moral enough to provide basic nutrition, shelter and adequate health coverage to all their citizens.

<li id="fn:eefdcd66b28c2b86ef84bba398f2d59a:3">Actually getting rid of ones office phone is harder than you might think, at least at my university.  I tried for several years to officially have my phone removed and save the University from having to pay for it, but failed to make any headway on this, and eventually gave up and just put the phone in a file cabinet.  This worked for a few years, but a recent horrendously expensive university-wide effort to <a href="https://news.virginia.edu/content/university-s-first-voip-phones-make-their-maiden-flight">upgrade phones to use VoIP</a>, led to me being asked several times what kind of new tethered phone I wanted in my office.  Despite stating I didn&rsquo;t want one, someone snuck one into my office last week, and now the department is paying several hundred dollars a year for me to keep it in my file cabinet.
